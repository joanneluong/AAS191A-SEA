                    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                    <p>
                        Under the misconception of the model minority myth, Asian Americans are viewed as a monolith, framed as being studious, smart, well off, and more harmful stereotypes.
                        This harmful portrayal of Asian Americans disregards the community conditions of Southeast Asian Americans, as it sees all Asian Americans as the same. 
                        Southeast Asian American communities are overlooked in data when lumped in with other Asian Americans, calling for the push of disaggregated data that accurately portrays these communities.
                        Southeast Asian Americans have been historically underrepresented in higher education and have low retention rates, with data from the mid 2000s showing that 65.8% of Cambodian, 66.5% of Laotian, 63.2% of Hmong, and 51.1% of Vietnamese Americans have not attended college (AAPI Data 2017).
                        Beyond these communities attending college, their retention is even more imperative.
                        Colleges are often not equipped with the resources to aid these specific communities, which does nothing to aid the push for Southeast Asian retention.
                        At UCLA, only 17.1% of the AAPI population identifies as Southeast Asian.
                        Though there are some resources for the Southeast Asian community on campus such as SEA Clear (Southeast Asian Campus Learning and Retention) and programs like SEA Admit Weekend, there needs to be better university wide support for this population, as these are entirely student led programs.
                        These programs are tasked to support hundreds of Southeast Asian students, with very limited and extremely overworked student staff members.

                    <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project aims to highlight the relationship between the pursuit of higher education by Southeast Asians and the levels of support experienced at UCLA.
                        It will help empower Southeast Asian students at UCLA by disaggregating their narratives from the monolithic stereotypes of Asian people.
                        Through this project, we plan to work with Southeast Asian interest groups on campus to identify the unique challenges that Southeast Asian students face in college.
                        While the data collected will only be for those who are already enrolled in an institution of higher education (namely, UCLA), it still touches upon the issue of retention, and these individuals' opinions and experiences with resources for Southeast Asian students at UCLA.
                        By allowing these stories to be shared in our project, we hope to raise awareness of the specific issues faced by Southeast Asian students and where they have found support while pursuing higher education.
                        Moreover, our mapplication involves asking students about support resources at UCLA.
                        By doing so, we hope that our project can be a resource for other students to reach out to locations on/near campus that have supported their peers.

                    <h2>IMPACT</h2>
                    <p>
                        The long-term impacts of this project are several.
                        We hope that our map can highlight the relationship between the areas Southeast Asian students reside in and the experience they have in pursuing higher education.
                        Besides that, the anecdotes provided by the SEA community can provide insight for college administrators, namely UCLA, to better understand their needs and provide on-going academic support for them.
                        Currently, there is only one active organization in UCLA, SEA CLEAR at UCLA, that works toward improving SEA student retention rates.
                        We hope that our project can complement SEA CLEAR's efforts by providing additional resources and perspectives for SEA students, ultimately leading to higher retention rates and a more inclusive environment for all students at UCLA.
