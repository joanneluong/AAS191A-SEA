## U-SEA-LA: Southeast Asian Experiences
Our project aim to address the inequality faced by the Southeast Asian community, specifically regarding the retention rate and access to higher education. This community has been historically marginalized, and many face significant barriers to obtaining a higher education, which can lead to long-term economic and social disadvantages. The mapplication aims to empower the Southeast Asian community by bringing awareness to the issues they face and highlighting the disparities in access to higher education. This tool can help individuals and organizations understand the scope of the problem and work towards solutions that promote educational equity and inclusivity.
