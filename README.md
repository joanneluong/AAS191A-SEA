## Objective
This project aims to highlight the relationship between the pursuit of higher education by Southeast Asians and the levels of support experienced at UCLA. It will help empower Southeast Asian students at UCLA by disaggregating their narratives from the monolithic stereotypes of Asian people. Through this project, we plan to work with Southeast Asian interest groups on campus to identify the unique challenges that Southeast Asian students face in college. While the data collected will only be for those who are already enrolled in an institution of higher education (namely, UCLA), it still touches upon the issue of retention, and these individuals' opinions and experiences with resources for Southeast Asian students at UCLA. By allowing these stories to be shared in our project, we hope to raise awareness of the specific issues faced by Southeast Asian students and where they have found support while pursuing higher education. Moreover, our mapplication involves asking students about support resources at UCLA. By doing so, we hope that our project can be a resource for other students to reach out to locations on/near campus that have supported their peers.
	
## Who is being empowered
This project can empower the community of Southeast Asian students at UCLA, including both current and future students. By sharing their personal experiences being Southeast Asian in college and how they navigated through the system, students can gain valuable insights and strategies to overcome challenges and make the most of their educational journey. Additionally, this project aims to create a sense of belonging and solidarity among Southeast Asian students by fostering a supportive network where individuals can connect, collaborate, and uplift one another.


Our project will empower the general UCLA student community, including both current and future Bruins, as both groups will benefit from increased awareness about waste habits, reduction, and impact. Community members concerned about sustainability and waste reduction, as well as those less aware of the consistent waste problem will have their voices and personal experiences shared. Additionally, students living on and off-campus will be able to share their experiences, accounting for the varying habits and resources available for the two groups.
