## Objective
This project aims to highlight the relationship between the pursuit of higher education by Southeast Asians and the levels of support experienced at UCLA. It will help empower Southeast Asian students at UCLA by disaggregating their narratives from the monolithic stereotypes of Asian people. Through this project, we plan to work with Southeast Asian interest groups on campus to identify the unique challenges that Southeast Asian students face in college. While the data collected will only be for those who are already enrolled in an institution of higher education (namely, UCLA), it still touches upon the issue of retention, and these individuals' opinions and experiences with resources for Southeast Asian students at UCLA. By allowing these stories to be shared in our project, we hope to raise awareness of the specific issues faced by Southeast Asian students and where they have found support while pursuing higher education. Moreover, our mapplication involves asking students about support resources at UCLA. By doing so, we hope that our project can be a resource for other students to reach out to locations on/near campus that have supported their peers.
