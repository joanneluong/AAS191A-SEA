## Objective
This project aims to highlight the relationship between the pursuit of higher education by Southeast Asians and the levels of support experienced at UCLA. It will help empower Southeast Asian students at UCLA by disaggregating their narratives from the monolithic stereotypes of Asian people. Through this project, we plan to work with Southeast Asian interest groups on campus to identify the unique challenges that Southeast Asian students face in college. While the data collected will only be for those who are already enrolled in UCLA, an institution of higher education, it still touches upon the issue of retention, and these individuals' opinions and experiences with resources for Southeast Asian students at UCLA. By allowing these stories to be shared in our project, we hope to raise awareness of the specific issues faced by Southeast Asian students and where they have found support while pursuing higher education. Moreover, our mapplication involves asking students about support resources at UCLA. By doing so, we hope that our project can be a resource for other students to reach out to locations on/near campus that have supported their peers.
	
## Who is being empowered
This project can empower the community of Southeast Asian students at UCLA, including both current and future students. By sharing their personal experiences being Southeast Asian in college and how they navigated through the system, students can gain valuable insights and strategies to overcome challenges and make the most of their educational journey. Additionally, this project aims to create a sense of belonging and solidarity among Southeast Asian students by fostering a supportive network where individuals can connect, collaborate, and uplift one another.

## How it can be repurposed
#### Long Term Impact
We hope that our map can highlight the areas in UCLA Southeast Asian students feel the most supported in and the experience they have in pursuing higher education. Besides that, the anecdotes provided by the SEA community can provide insight for UCLA, to better understand their needs and provide on-going academic support for them. Currently, there is only one active organization in UCLA, SEA CLEAR at UCLA, that works toward improving SEA student retention rates. We hope that our project can complement SEA CLEAR's efforts by providing additional resources and perspectives for SEA students, ultimately leading to higher retention rates and a more inclusive environment for all students at UCLA.

#### Future Implications
In the future, we hope that more Southeast Asian students in UCLA can contribute to this mapplication. Furthermore, as more Southeast Asian students in UCLA contribute their unique perspectives and insights to this mapplication, it will serve as a platform for mutual learning and collaboration. The wider UCLA student body can gain a deeper understanding of the Southeast Asian experience by engaging with this website, fostering a stronger culture of inclusivity.
